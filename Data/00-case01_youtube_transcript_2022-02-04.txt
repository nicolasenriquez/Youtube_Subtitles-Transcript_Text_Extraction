00:00
in this video you're gonna see me an X
00:03
bein consultant interviewing Bruno and X
00:05
McKinsey consultant using a McKinsey
00:08
style case that would be in a real life
00:11
interview and mbb level case probably a
00:14
hard one that you could find either in a
00:17
first round or any last round interview
00:19
we made this video in a way that you can
00:21
work through the video so on each
00:24
question I asked Bruno you can pause the
00:27
video if you want and try to answer like
00:29
you would and then you can compare the
00:30
answers let's get straight to the video
00:33
your friend wants to acquire a Badman
00:36
ecommerce business but he's unsure
00:38
whether this is an attractive market or
00:40
not okay and he's asked you for help to
00:43
assess that so what are the three or
00:45
four factors you'd analyze to determine
00:47
whether this is an attractive market or
00:49
not okay so it's gonna purchase he wants
00:56
to acquire that been in bet ecommerce or
00:59
an e-commerce store that sells livings
01:01
and sheets bed sheets and pills and
01:04
dolls and stuff like that and he just
01:07
wants to know if the market is
01:09
attractive or not is that right that's
01:11
right
01:12
so if he doesn't want to know or whether
01:14
he should acquire the business or not
01:15
you just want your help to see if the
01:17
market is attractive okay so no
01:19
recommendation in terms of yes you
01:21
should just market attractiveness purely
01:24
right okay I have a couple more
01:27
clarifying questions the first is is
01:33
this who's this friend I mean is he
01:37
because I think it's weird that an
01:39
individual is purchasing a company okay
01:43
so we're really rich or yeah he's all
01:45
about the financial market he's he's
01:49
made a lot of money there and he wants
01:51
to go out and just have his own business
01:53
that he can run and improve she doesn't
01:56
want he doesn't want to start from
01:56
scratch and he has a feeling
01:59
yeah good deal but she doesn't yet know
02:01
with the market itself is attractive
02:03
okay so if I understand he wants to
02:07
acquire himself into intrapreneurship
02:09
yeah okay good
02:12
and the second question is does he have
02:19
a specific way of understanding
02:21
attractiveness and I know this is kind
02:24
of the question of the case but are
02:26
there any specific things that he thinks
02:30
make a market attractive arounds no we'd
02:33
also like your help with that okay that
02:35
sounds good
02:36
is he looking into a specifically
02:38
commerce company no not yet Jenny yes he
02:43
does have a deal in mind okay we're not
02:45
gonna look into that there okay because
02:47
we're looking at the market yeah okay
02:49
that sounds good so I'm gonna take maybe
02:52
a couple of minutes to to structure the
02:54
case if it's all right
03:19
okay I'm ready just in seven okay all
03:24
right blood okay so I'd look into four
03:27
broad areas and I kind of came up with
03:30
this framework to evaluate market
03:33
attractiveness in this specific scenario
03:36
of a individual purchasing in e-commerce
03:38
company okay so I'd look into four areas
03:41
the first is if the market is attractive
03:44
in the sense that they can make money so
03:46
our companies in this market profitable
03:49
and likely to make money in the future
03:52
the second aspect is if you can hold a
03:56
competitive advantage in this market so
03:58
and coming from the assumption that some
04:00
markets allow for more competitive
04:03
advantage than others the third one is
04:07
if you can build a customer base so if
04:10
he can build a basically a list of
04:13
customers that he can monetize and serve
04:16
in the future so another long term view
04:19
okay and I know this overlaps a bit with
04:22
can he make money or not put in the can
04:25
he make money I'm looking at the current
04:27
companies in the market and then the
04:29
customer base I'm looking more into
04:31
customer behavior okay and then the
04:34
fourth is is this a nice business to run
04:36
I mean he's with another business it has
04:39
to be attractive for him personally as
04:41
well make sense okay so with him he can
04:44
he make money within the first bucket
04:46
and look into three factors the first is
04:49
the size and growth of the market that
04:51
InBev ecommerce I'd love to see a big
04:55
markets that grows a lot okay and
04:58
specific segments that were all even
05:00
more I'd like to see the profitability
05:03
of the current players so maybe this is
05:05
a big markets and
05:07
losing money not very attractive and the
05:10
third one is the price sensitivity of
05:13
the customers if everyone on the
05:15
internet is charging the same price for
05:17
the same items it's really hard for you
05:20
to try to premium or to differentiate in
05:24
some way unless these companies are
05:26
really profitable then you can charge
05:27
less and maybe grab a higher market ship
05:30
okay okay the second book is competitive
05:33
advantage and look into three things as
05:35
well the first is waste different shades
05:38
what are ways to differentiate your
05:40
company in this market and
05:42
differentiation will enable you to get
05:44
more market share or charge more for the
05:47
same products okay the second one is
05:50
ways to be more efficient are there ways
05:52
to be more efficient in this market one
05:54
example that comes to mind is maybe you
05:57
can have a more efficient warehouse and
05:59
logistics or a more efficient
06:02
[Music]
06:04
IT development things like that so this
06:07
will help you keep costs down maybe
06:10
purchasing as well and then the third
06:12
bonus barriers to entry I honestly don't
06:16
see many in this market perhaps the
06:19
initial investment that you need to make
06:21
but this is important because if it's a
06:24
really attractive market with a lot of
06:27
ways to differentiate yourself with very
06:29
little barriers to entry what's stopping
06:32
people from signing other companies and
06:34
making this market a price war in the
06:38
future for example okay right within
06:40
customer base I'd look for how easy it
06:44
is to get traffic even if this is a
06:47
wonderfully attractive market with lots
06:51
of ways to differentiate if we can't get
06:54
traffic is not going to be able to grow
06:56
his site
06:57
second one is customer loyalty so if he
07:02
gets a customer is this a customer for
07:04
life is this person likely to buy from
07:07
him in the future or is this someone
07:10
who's just shopping for price and I know
07:12
there's some relationship with
07:15
sincerity but I'm looking to different
07:17
things here pricing services they're
07:19
looking for the cheaper price customer
07:22
loyalty is they're more likely to shop
07:24
from you if he's bought from you in the
07:27
past okay and then the third one is
07:30
opportunities for cross selling so if he
07:34
gets customers and then he can he has
07:36
lots of types of products that he can
07:39
sell in the future that's a more
07:42
attractive market than the market that
07:44
you have nothing else to sell right and
07:47
then the last item if this is a nice
07:49
business room from a personal
07:51
perspective I'd look at two things the
07:54
first is what are the operational
07:55
demands of this business is this a
07:57
business that it's gonna wake him up at
07:59
3:00 in the morning or not
08:02
okay my guess is probably not I mean you
08:05
can ship stuff every day and have people
08:08
handling that and usually nowadays
08:13
websites don't crash in the middle of
08:15
the night so doesn't seem like a
08:17
business with too many operational
08:19
demands but I would Mack the operations
08:21
of this site and see if there are any
08:23
critical points that can make his life a
08:25
nightmare
08:26
all right and the second one is how much
08:30
strategy work is he gonna do versus
08:33
operational firefighting work and the
08:37
reason why I'm doing this is he came
08:38
from the financial markets so I'm
08:41
guessing that this guy wants to think
08:43
about strategy about long term planning
08:46
versus just run an operation and it's a
08:50
guess we have to check with him of
08:52
course but I think this will be
08:54
interesting from a career perspective is
08:56
this the kind of thing that he wants to
08:58
run okay all right very interesting just
09:01
a question that I've addressed
09:03
yeah so you mentioned customer loyalty
09:04
sure and I didn't quite grasp one thing
09:08
would it be good for their position or
09:11
would it be bad for their position if
09:12
there is customer loyalty sure that's
09:15
that's a good question customer is
09:17
awesome
09:20
and the reason is and hey guys probably
09:24
not use the word awesome in the real
09:26
piece but I'm with customer is is really
09:30
good say you spent $20 to a fire
09:33
customer and this guy's buys from you
09:38
once a $40 item and you have 50 percent
09:43
marginal net you broke even to get this
09:47
customer if you don't sell anything to
09:50
him in the future you're not gonna make
09:52
money now if this person is likely to
09:56
shop with you five or ten times in the
09:58
future you can even spend $50 $100 to to
10:02
to get him in and you're still gonna
10:04
make a profit so customer loyalty is a
10:08
really good feature of a market here
10:10
because either you can have higher
10:13
margins because you're spending less in
10:15
marketing to get the same number of
10:17
customers or you're spending more on
10:19
marketing and you've gotta grow faster
10:22
and super profitable compared to a
10:24
market with low customer loyalty Karen
10:27
co-found good now your friend has
10:30
decided that it will make sense for him
10:32
to acquire the company but only if he
10:35
can increase sales significantly okay
10:38
and he's asked for help to come up with
10:40
ideas on how to increase sales okay what
10:44
are some options we can think of how to
10:46
increase sales okay do you have any
10:50
information on where the sales come from
10:53
in the current business no we don't okay
10:58
can I assume that they sell sheets
11:01
towels
11:03
oh you mean product wise yeah sure and
11:05
also if there are b2c it versus b2b
11:08
sales I'll try to figure out the notes
11:10
of revenues okay right they found Paul
11:13
b2c okay and all kind of products within
11:17
the bed and the bathroom in the towels
11:22
and brothers part okay is it just
11:24
fabrics or do they sell mattresses and
11:27
furnitures no they don't sell mattresses
11:29
furniture soap holders everything that's
11:32
not fabric they will sell ok ok so our
11:36
goal is to increase sales right if we're
11:45
gonna increase sales we can increase
11:47
sales in the business as is right or we
11:56
can change the business excess if we
12:03
change the business I think we can get
12:10
new types of customers do you know if
12:14
there's specific segments of the market
12:16
that hit targets nowadays no we don't
12:20
know that okay so this could be a b2b
12:25
for example we can get well sell
12:30
actually sell new types of products that
12:36
are related to this market or we can
12:39
enter other markets okay and in the
12:46
business as is
12:48
we can also sorry we could also go
12:50
offline in the business as is we can get
12:58
new customers right we can increase
13:06
tickets yeah so the average sale or we
13:12
can increase number of sales per
13:16
customer right okay and just to be clear
13:21
here get new customers is new customers
13:24
of the current type of customer getting
13:26
and in the bottom part of my issue tree
13:30
is getting new types of customers ok ok
13:33
so just some ideas to get new custom
13:36
you could explore new channels I don't
13:39
know how he gets the customers nowadays
13:41
if it's Google ads or Facebook ads but
13:45
he can try other types of strategies to
13:47
get new customers even offline
13:50
advertising maybe content marketing I
13:54
don't know there's a bunch of channels
13:57
you could explore here to increase
13:59
ticket average sale I could of course
14:02
increase prices and that could be
14:05
increasing prices on the current
14:07
products or putting more premium
14:09
products he could improve his
14:11
recommendation algorithm as Amazon does
14:14
he could also cross cross sell by adding
14:20
new categories so you can sell other
14:23
products to buyers by having better
14:26
recommendations but also adding new
14:27
categories so what do people who buy
14:30
sheets and towels and things like that
14:34
are doing they're probably moving
14:36
perhaps getting married having kids and
14:42
what what else are these people shopping
14:44
for they're shopping for decoration
14:47
maybe kitchen appliances so he could
14:50
expand and this is actually sell new
14:53
types of products so I'm kind of getting
14:56
ahead of myself here all right within
14:59
sales number of sales per customer work
15:02
in our customer relationship so sending
15:06
emails doing the basic ecommerce stuff
15:09
we could send coupons for that for the
15:12
next sale yeah I think these are my best
15:18
ideas in changing the business you can
15:22
get new types of customers so b2b you
15:24
can focus on hotels hospitals who else
15:29
shops for towels yeah I think that's
15:33
that's mainly it may be all the air B&B
15:36
folds were renting their apartments
15:39
nowadays selling new types of products I
15:44
would look for products that are similar
15:48
to
15:48
the cells I said before so certain types
15:51
of furniture mattresses and other things
15:54
that you shop in the specific occasion
15:56
that these customers are shopping and we
15:58
need to study that just to know what
16:01
what really are discussed immers doing
16:04
and then entering other markets would be
16:07
setting up other e-commerce stores I
16:10
don't think it makes a lot of sense and
16:12
going offline I don't think it makes a
16:14
lot of sense either unless that's
16:15
something that our client wants to do a
16:18
lot but it would be opening retail
16:21
stores okay are there other identical I
16:28
surely can think of more ideas within
16:30
these buckets but I'm not sure I can
16:33
think of other buckets not really within
16:36
the buckets that's what I'm looking for
16:38
just couple more ideas okay sure
16:43
do we know if let's focus on the
16:46
businesses it's right there doesn't want
16:48
to change any bases at first do we know
16:50
if has problems with getting your
16:51
customers or increasing ticket or
16:54
because I want to focus on where they
16:56
the problem so we don't really know the
16:58
problems that this company has
17:00
beforehand but we do believe that we if
17:03
we want increase sales significantly
17:05
it's probably going to be through
17:07
getting new customers okay so I would
17:10
try to do this by increasing awareness
17:13
what right and then there is a
17:17
percentage of people who are aware who
17:20
visit okay right so by increasing
17:25
awareness I think they're there is their
17:28
ads so I'm good for all the channels
17:32
that make sense for ads Facebook
17:34
Instagram Instagram is actually a really
17:37
good one because it's a really visual
17:39
product it's Instagram and Google
17:46
basically so people who are looking for
17:49
these types of products or warrant
17:52
specific type of situation just got
17:55
married I put an ad on face
17:57
right I'd also use influencers to raise
18:02
awareness and by influencers I mean
18:04
digital influencers true but also
18:08
architects home decorators we can do
18:12
deals with them for promoting your
18:14
products or write them and then there is
18:17
also PR normal TV ads things like that
18:22
now to increase the percentage who visit
18:25
what I think would make sense is to do
18:27
some kind of promotion so if you access
18:31
our site now you get a free pillow if
18:34
you spend more than $300 or get 10%
18:37
discount so some sort of incentive to
18:42
have this person visit and also
18:45
something that's not really measurable
18:46
but tends to work is to work on the
18:50
branding of the website is there a
18:52
really professional websites are the ads
18:54
professional doing every I mean we're
18:57
working with design in a certain way
18:59
right so you try out pretty websites and
19:06
okay all right sounds good now one more
19:11
ideas sorry we couldn't remember get
19:14
member campaign some websites do this if
19:16
you shopped with us and you recommend a
19:19
friend you get 30% off in your next
19:23
purchase and then we get new customers
19:25
and repeat buyers all right cool so you
19:30
and your friend ran some analysis of the
19:32
of three large revenue levers and you
19:37
watch the following data this after
19:40
acquisition your friend starts selling
19:42
in marketplaces like Amazon for example
19:45
not only in their own website their
19:47
sales will increase by 40%
19:49
okay if they start selling complementary
19:53
categories of products like you've sent
19:55
their sales will increase by 30% and the
20:00
e-commerce market segments will
20:02
organically grow 80% due to the increase
20:06
of the total market and increase off
20:08
share the
20:09
happens online through e-commerce okay
20:12
so bed and bath ecommerce as combined
20:17
category is gonna grow eighty percent
20:19
yeah that's right
20:20
partly because bottom bath market will
20:23
grow and partly because the sheriff
20:25
e-commerce will grow yeah okay and
20:27
that's all within the next two years
20:28
okay so that's two years so it's good
20:33
and knowing that the company's current
20:35
market share is twelve percent what will
20:38
be their market share after those two
20:40
years mm-hmm current market share is
20:46
twelve percent and we need the new
20:51
market share in two years that's right
20:59
that's what we want yeah and this market
21:01
share is within barren bet ecommerce
21:05
yeah not within the overall bed net
21:07
market yeah that's right
21:09
okay sounds good so I can assume that
21:12
they're gonna execute on the marketplace
21:14
idea and the new product categories yeah
21:16
okay and I just noticed that I could
21:18
have added get into new online faster as
21:23
well yeah my fault okay okay let me
21:27
think for a bit just to structure this
21:29
analysis so we can can we assume that we
21:35
will grow with the market at eighty
21:37
percent
21:37
yeah okay okay so this factor alone
21:41
market growth will not impact our market
21:43
share right because we're gonna grow
21:45
eighty percent the overall market is
21:47
gonna grow up 80 percent as well so for
21:50
this factor it doesn't really matter
21:52
that's right that's right so we're gonna
21:56
grow 40 percent revenues with
22:01
marketplaces and I will assume that the
22:03
rest of the markets on average will not
22:05
do that yeah and we're going to
22:07
30% with no product categories and I
22:10
will assume that the rest of the market
22:12
will not grow that either yeah that's
22:14
right okay right so to find the new
22:17
market share all I have to do is to
22:21
multiply our current market share of 12%
22:24
by 1.4 to include the marketplace effect
22:28
and by 1.3 which include the new product
22:31
categories effect and I will compound
22:34
both because we're gonna be selling new
22:36
product categories in marketplaces as
22:38
well okay make sense yet so let me
22:42
compound this issue effects first
22:46
marketplaces times you product is the
22:53
multiplier that I will do with the
22:55
current market rate that's 1.4
22:58
because it's 40% times 1.3 right okay so
23:05
I think it's easier to do the math here
23:14
I could do 30% of 124 actually that's
23:18
easier and it's right
23:21
30% to 1.4 okay so 10% of 1.4 is 0.14
23:27
right times 3 that if this was 0.15 this
23:33
would be 0.45 and then I take 3 decimals
23:37
of it so point 42 right the other trial
23:42
and so 1 point 4 plus OH point 42 equals
23:48
1 point 8 2 which is our multiplier to
23:54
12% okay okay so now I just have to do
23:59
the new market share is going to be one
24:01
point beta 2 times 12 percent let me
24:08
find a quick way to do this if I can
24:16
okay ten times 1.82 is 18.2 mm-hmm and
24:23
two times 1.82 is three point sixty four
24:30
okay okay so eighty four sorry so we
24:41
have twenty we will have twenty one
24:43
point two eighty four percent market
24:46
share okay what do you think of that
24:49
this question I think that makes sense
24:52
it's slightly less than so first the
24:55
calculation I think my calculation seems
24:58
right because this is likely less than
25:03
twice the 12% figure who I have nowadays
25:07
and it should be a bit less than twice
25:11
because we're compounding 40 percent and
25:14
30 percent if you sum those up seven
25:16
seventy percent so it should be slightly
25:19
higher than that so the figure seems
25:22
fine okay in terms of the business and
25:25
whether this is an interesting market or
25:28
not I think just by doing two relatively
25:34
simple actions we can get 1/5 of the
25:39
market or just over 1/5 of the market
25:42
this seems like a pretty good
25:43
opportunity because we're dealing with a
25:45
market that will grow 80 percent which
25:50
is really good in two years right by any
25:52
standards and we can still almost double
25:57
our presence in the market and have some
25:59
sort of market power and recognition at
26:03
least on the online channel just by
26:07
doing two simple actions so it seems
26:09
like our markets that well obviously
26:11
it's going to grow out we can trust this
26:13
figure but also a market that you can
26:16
capture a lot of it with simple
26:20
improvements I mean we're not talking
26:21
about crazy algorithm
26:23
changes in e-commerce you're just
26:26
talking about adding new product
26:28
categories and any new channel okay all
26:32
right that makes sense now
26:34
well you're meeting with your friend is
26:36
almost over and you're gonna go back to
26:39
doing consulting is gonna go back to
26:40
looking into man-bat ecommerce
26:43
businesses and he was just your partial
26:47
opinion just based on what you have what
26:49
you know should he acquire this business
26:53
or not okay
26:55
good question I can't tell him that you
26:58
should acquire this business because we
26:59
haven't looked into the business yet
27:01
yeah but I will say that this market
27:09
looks like a really good opportunity
27:11
right it's a growing market we haven't
27:14
seen if it's profitable or not but just
27:18
for the fact that it's growing a lot and
27:20
that with small changes you can get
27:23
twenty two percent market share would be
27:26
a nice play to just acquire the company
27:31
grow it a lot and then perhaps sell it
27:33
later to confirm that I will just look
27:37
at three things the first is if we can
27:39
trust these figures okay
27:41
the second is I would do a quick to jib
27:44
diligence on the company its numbers and
27:46
its operations and then the third thing
27:50
if our friends skills match what's
27:55
needed to run this business and
27:57
implement these changes and other
27:59
changes that we can okay all right well

00:00
did you ever wonder how a real
00:01
consultant would do in a real case
00:03
interview that's what you're gonna see
00:04
today I'm Giulio a next bein consultant
00:07
and today in this video I'm gonna
00:09
interview Bruno an expert Kinsey
00:11
consultant I'm gonna use a case that is
00:15
very similar to what I got in the last
00:17
interview with my final round at Bain
00:19
and at first glance is just a simple
00:22
profitability case where the interviewer
00:24
just wants to see if you can build and
00:26
analytically work with a profit tree but
00:29
in reality it's not
00:30
I've used this case for coaching
00:32
hundreds of times and I'm confident to
00:34
say only probably three out of ten
00:36
candidates can actually do an offer
00:39
deserving performance at their first try
00:41
but enough chitchat already let's get to
00:44
the case and see how Bruna deals with it
00:46
so your client is a auto
00:49
biomanufacturing the United States ok
00:52
and they are faced with in the last five
00:54
years a profitability decrease their
00:57
profitability has decreased from five to
00:59
2.5%
01:00
well the competitors average rules from
01:04
three point five percent to more than
01:06
that nowadays yeah so we're at two point
01:08
five and competitors are above three
01:11
point five okay you've been hired to
01:14
help them restore their profitability
01:15
over the next two years or so okay how
01:18
would you help them do that
01:20
okay great question so couple clarifying
01:24
questions first did our competitors
01:27
profitability as decreased as well our
01:30
competitors profitability has increased
01:32
has increased to three point five from
01:35
three point five to something that we
01:37
don't know okay so they used to be a
01:39
three point five lower than us because
01:41
we were at five yeah and they have
01:44
increased their profitability while we
01:46
have decreased that's right okay that's
01:48
interesting it doesn't seem like it's an
01:50
industry-wide problem right another
01:54
question are we a regular auto
01:56
manufacturer is this global a real
01:59
luxury cars or just mass market we have
02:02
all kinds of cars okay the brands within
02:04
our manufacturer we do sell only in the
02:08
United States
02:09
okay so we're just in the united that
02:14
sounds good so the first step that i
02:18
would do to solve this problem is to
02:20
find out if this is a revenue problem or
02:23
a cost problem and if we have data on
02:27
that we'd like to get that now just so I
02:29
can focus on the right branch or I can
02:31
develop my issue tree matter whichever
02:33
you prefer okay we do have data on that
02:35
so our revenues have increased from 21
02:40
billion to twenty two point five billion
02:42
dollars twenty to twenty five okay
02:44
while our costs have increased from
02:46
twenty billion dollars to twenty two
02:48
billion dollars okay so it does seem
02:53
like a cost problem just to confirm that
02:56
it is a cost problem how's our pricing
02:59
our average price per car doing and I'm
03:03
asking this because it could be that our
03:06
revenues have increased because we have
03:08
dropped prices increased volume sold and
03:11
this raising cost is just to reflect the
03:15
increase in cost to make more cars okay
03:17
that makes sense our price has stayed
03:20
the same from $30,000 to $30,000 per
03:23
average when I mix of products changed
03:27
because maybe the average is the same
03:29
but we're selling more sports cars for a
03:33
lower price and yeah this question so
03:35
not really no okay the mix hasn't
03:38
changed okay so we don't have a pricing
03:41
problem which means that we don't have a
03:43
revenue problem that's right so we need
03:45
to explore costs better and what I do
03:48
now is to understand the cost structure
03:52
of this company
03:53
and get a cost breakdown to see which
03:55
cost has increased okay and I see here
04:02
there are direct costs and there are
04:05
indirect costs I believe this is how
04:09
most manufacturers would categorize
04:11
those costs we think the direct cost are
04:15
fixed and variable costs
04:20
I believe all indirect costs are
04:22
fixed and yeah I'd like to know the cost
04:26
breakdown so within variable that would
04:28
there would be parts there would be
04:32
energy there'd be label for
04:36
manufacturing and perhaps yeah sales
04:40
would be indirect and then within fixed
04:43
costs there is the factory right is
04:48
there a new direct cluster and me see
04:50
okay well that's pretty close but we do
04:53
have a cost breakdown that our client
04:55
use okay so you can use the face yeah
04:57
that's okay we can go with materials
05:00
costs okay
05:01
so labor costs factory related costs
05:07
okay and other costs for the indirect
05:10
costs okay great so no energy yeah okay
05:14
sounds good and what what happened to
05:16
this costs okay
05:17
so material costs have gone from 50% of
05:23
total costs to 52% of total costs okay
05:29
labor costs has stayed stable state has
05:32
stay stable and twenty percent twenty
05:35
before and 20 percent afterwards right
05:38
and of course the total has increased
05:40
because total plus CSS right and both
05:43
factory costs and indirect costs have
05:46
decreased from 15 each to 14 each ok so
05:50
it went from 15% of 4% okay that sounds
05:59
good so just to get a it seems like the
06:03
problems on materials okay I just want
06:06
to tie back to the two billion plus
06:08
increase just to see how much of that
06:11
was caused by material so before I had
06:14
fifty percent of twenty billion so we
06:17
had ten billion dollars yeah and now we
06:21
have 52 percent of twenty two didn't so
06:25
if this were fifty percent of twenty two
06:28
would be eleven billion dollars yeah now
06:32
I have two percent of twenty
06:36
- which is 0.4 t four billion right so
06:43
1% would have been points 22 billion so
06:46
yes point forty four so now material
06:49
costs is at 11.40 four billion right so
06:57
we have increased two billion total
07:01
costs and we have increased one point
07:09
forty four billion so that's a 75%
07:13
mature costs represent roughly 75% of
07:17
the total cost increase okay so I'm
07:21
gonna focus on materials because it
07:24
represents most of the costs increase
07:26
because it's the line that has gained
07:28
the cost line that has gained most share
07:32
and then if you can't solve the cost
07:35
problem in the profitability problem
07:38
through material costs we're gonna come
07:40
back and work on labor indirect and
07:43
fixed alright to make sense okay what do
07:47
you want to do so I wanna investigate
07:49
why material costs have increased and
07:54
what do you think that's a good question
07:56
so let's think of the possibilities here
08:00
why has material costs increased one
08:10
clarifying question that I'd like to ask
08:12
is do we know if our competitors
08:15
material costs have increased as well we
08:18
don't really know that no okay because
08:20
that would be really informative
08:24
information to have because they
08:26
probably buy the same parts from the
08:29
same supplier so what I would do here is
08:31
break down materials into the different
08:34
types of materials so we have steel we
08:39
have outer parts we have tires glasses
08:47
like electrics
08:50
all this stuff we buy and I would try to
08:53
understand which one has increased and
08:57
then I'd ask why again so say if steel
09:00
are we purchasing different types of C
09:03
or from different suppliers or what's
09:06
going on but the first step would be to
09:08
understand which category of purchased
09:11
parts is increased
09:12
okay alright we do have data on that
09:14
actually so our materials are broken
09:18
down into auto parts steel plastics and
09:22
others okay so you were your vehicles
09:26
yeah and as a percentage of materials
09:31
Auto Parts has increased from 60% to 65%
09:35
as a percentage of materials yeah so
09:38
we're talking about a eleven point forty
09:41
four billion yeah okay auto parts went
09:44
from 60 to 65% that's right okay steel
09:49
and plastics both decrease from 15 to 13
09:53
percent okay and other costs has
09:58
decreased from 10 percent to 9 percent
10:01
okay that's interesting so it seems like
10:04
it all comes from auto parts we can't
10:07
know for sure unless we do the math so
10:10
I'm gonna do the math really quickly we
10:12
had sixty percent of 10 billion we used
10:15
to purchase six billion in auto parts
10:18
and now we're purchasing 65% of 11.40
10:23
for doing okay tough math to do here so
10:31
let me divide this into fifty percent
10:34
plus ten percent plus five percent 50
10:38
percent of 11.40 for is well 50 percent
10:43
of point four four is points 22 and
10:46
fifty percent of 11 is five point five
10:50
so five point five plus points 22 is
10:56
5.72 that's 50% of the total bill that's
11:00
right then 10 percent is
11:03
point 14 or 144 I'm just gonna let's do
11:08
the exact math here okay and then five
11:11
percent is ten percent of the fifty
11:15
percent so it's zero point five seven
11:19
two so so me all up we have six 2 plus 4
11:26
is 6 plus 7 is 13 7.36 wait wait wait
11:40
wait pause did you see that 65 percent
11:43
of eleven point forty four billion is
11:46
seven point four thirty six not seven
11:48
point 36
11:49
brooder been a mistake there and i
11:51
didn't notice the vendors are so close
11:53
that I didn't catch my attention they
11:55
both rounded 27.4 and I actually only
11:57
noticed this when I was editing this
11:59
video in a real case interview it's
12:02
actually possible that the interviewer
12:03
doesn't notice a mistake but it's not
12:05
likely and what would have happened if I
12:07
had noticed it I'd have asked him are
12:10
you sure and that he would have one
12:12
chance of finding a fixing him to his
12:14
mistake if he did he'd be fine no big
12:17
deal if he didn't that he'd be trouble
12:20
is that right yeah that's right okay so
12:24
we went from six billion to seven points
12:27
36 which is an increase of one point 36
12:38
one point 36 billion so not all costs
12:42
from materials increased come from auto
12:45
parts but the vast majority of it we'll
12:48
compare one point 36 billion to one
12:50
point forty four billion total material
12:53
increase so let's focus on auto parts we
12:56
need to understand why outer part costs
12:58
that's gonna do we have any information
13:00
on what happens to our suppliers the
13:03
types of parts we buy or something in
13:07
supply chain not at all what do you
13:10
think
13:10
okay so let's raise some hypothesis on
13:14
what could have happened
13:15
you either will buy more parts and some
13:22
extent would have to buy more parts per
13:24
car because the materials cost has
13:30
raised more than the total revenue right
13:35
so that's why we're having profitability
13:37
problem or we'll pay more per part on
13:42
average do we know which one of those
13:44
who is the most responsible we don't
13:46
know what I'd like to see how about this
13:47
is both okay so cool so if we're
13:50
purchasing more parts per car maybe our
13:53
mix of parts has changed or we have new
14:00
products which is another source of mix
14:05
changing but then it's we caused it
14:08
instead of the orchids or the waste is
14:14
hired in our manufacturing chain right
14:17
now if the dollar per part has increased
14:20
so if we're paying more per part that's
14:24
either because we have switched to more
14:30
expensive suppliers or that happened at
14:35
same suppliers and if it did happens in
14:41
the same suppliers then either they're
14:45
making more money so their margins up or
14:48
their costs are up and they're sending
14:52
their costs to us okay why would I be
14:56
making more money perhaps because I'll
14:59
give you some ideas within here maybe
15:01
they have bought one another and now
15:06
they're more concentrated and we can
15:09
really bargain with them or they have
15:11
created switching costs so we can't
15:14
change suppliers maybe the tooling of
15:16
the equipment or they have patents of
15:20
certain parts designs it could also be
15:24
that we are getting really poor in
15:27
negotiation
15:28
so maybe we've changed our purchasing
15:34
force or our CP oh and our guys are not
15:38
doing a really good job negotiating
15:40
these spots okay all right I can believe
15:43
that
15:43
okay now as it turns out the problem is
15:48
that workers of auto parts manufacturers
15:51
in the USA have become recently
15:54
unionized okay and this has caused a
15:56
large increase in labor costs with
15:59
salaries and benefits increase for our
16:01
suppliers for all USA manufactures our
16:04
suppliers okay no just our suppliers but
16:08
all suppliers of auto parts in the USA
16:10
okay so this happened to our competitors
16:12
as well it did but other players in the
16:14
market have all forced the production of
16:17
their auto parts to other countries okay
16:20
and we're currently considering
16:21
outsourcing the production of our auto
16:24
parts to China okay what factors would
16:27
you take into consideration to decide
16:29
whether or not this is a good idea
16:31
okay so just see if I understand our
16:34
materials bill has increased because our
16:37
suppliers have higher costs this
16:39
happened with all suppliers in the chain
16:42
in the u.s. yeah and we're going to
16:45
consider it who should buy these parts
16:47
in China are we considering buying all
16:50
the parts or just some of them as many
16:53
as needed to bring our profitability
16:55
back to find myself okay and you need to
16:59
make sure that it's you want to know how
17:03
would I decide how would I have declined
17:07
the size if we should purchase these
17:08
parts in China all right okay sounds
17:11
good can can I take a minute to think
17:13
yeah take your time
17:34
okay so I would 2:05 different factors
17:40
to see if we should outsource or
17:44
actually import parts from China instead
17:47
of buying them from American suppliers
17:51
the first one is if it's actually going
17:53
to be cheaper if it's not going to be
17:55
cheaper in China for some reason I don't
17:57
want to do that yeah the second one is
18:00
if it meets the quality standards that
18:03
we expect okay because otherwise we're
18:09
gonna lose the quality of our product
18:10
and this is probably not acceptable
18:12
yeah the third thing is can we have a
18:14
predictable supply chain if we bring
18:18
parts from China all right it doesn't
18:21
make sense to get cheaper products but
18:25
then have manufacturing more expensive
18:27
or having the factory stop working and
18:31
so on yeah the fourth factor I'd look at
18:34
are other risks that are not considered
18:36
in the previous three buckets and
18:38
finally if there aren't better
18:40
alternatives because maybe all of this
18:42
box is checked for China but then there
18:45
are better alternatives so let me
18:47
explore in a bit more detail regarding
18:49
Cheaper are the parts going to be
18:52
cheaper the way I'd answer this question
18:54
would be to answer three questions the
18:55
first is figure out the cost of the
18:58
parts there okay in China the second
19:02
step would be to consider what are the
19:05
fixed costs in developing new suppliers
19:07
so it will cost something to have them
19:11
make the parts and learn to make our
19:13
parts at our quality standards and the
19:18
third thing is what is the cost to bring
19:20
parts from China to the US and then
19:23
there's all the shipping parts the
19:26
tariffs the exchange rates and
19:29
okay okay also there's a fourth factor
19:33
which we didn't put here but we will
19:36
probably need some operation there some
19:38
people checking suppliers and visiting
19:40
them as well okay
19:41
regarding quality I would try to
19:45
understand what is the manufacturing
19:47
expertise of these suppliers what are
19:50
the quality controls that they do it can
19:52
be trust them and then also I'd like to
19:54
see prototypes of our parts just to see
19:58
if this actually happens in real life or
20:01
if it's all theoretical on paper they're
20:03
really good but you know yeah okay
20:06
regarding the predictable supply chain
20:08
to look at three factors it as well the
20:11
first is the import issue how is the
20:16
process to import parts from China how
20:20
predictable is it how much leads time do
20:23
you need to order these parts and can we
20:26
work with these types of lead times okay
20:29
so assuming the supply chain is
20:31
predictable what are the steps and the
20:36
times of the process the second factor
20:39
is geopolitics are there geopolitical
20:44
risks that can make us you know not
20:49
receive parts for a whole month and then
20:53
what should we do about it okay yeah the
20:55
dividuals closed down the business and
20:58
the third thing is something that would
21:01
decrease the risk in supply chain which
21:03
is inventory how much should we raise
21:06
inventory how much can we raise
21:10
inventory to mitigate these risks and
21:13
this uncertainties and if so how much is
21:16
it gonna cost and again this brings us
21:19
back to the cheaper points up there okay
21:22
okay now some other risks to consider
21:26
one of them is intellectual property
21:29
can we trust our blueprints to these
21:31
Chinese suppliers I know some of them
21:35
have had trouble and other industries in
21:38
the past are we willing to risk our
21:41
designs with them and
21:43
if so which designs okay and this enters
21:46
a broader picture which is probably the
21:48
next step of this analysis if we choose
21:51
to send our parts of China which parts
21:53
probably not all of them you have to
21:57
make sense but that's our next step the
22:00
second risk that I would emphasize here
22:02
is the media or the public perception
22:05
we're going to be responsible for you
22:08
know taking drops out of America having
22:12
some suppliers bankrupt we use Chinese
22:15
parts in our cars is it possible that we
22:19
will lose market share doing this I know
22:22
our competitors are doing but maybe
22:25
we're gaining some some sales because
22:29
we're you guys who you know trust
22:35
American suppliers and give Americans
22:37
jobs and so on we need to try to size
22:40
the impact of that and the third class
22:44
of risks that I'd look at here is the
22:46
operational risk so and this includes
22:52
supply chain demand all the other things
22:55
but is it possible that we cannot get
22:59
parts in a certain situation because of
23:02
language barriers is it possible that a
23:05
certain event causes the port's not to
23:09
work well so all the predictable things
23:12
that we we had looked at in the quality
23:15
in these five key factors
23:17
what if they become unpredictable these
23:19
are risks okay okay and finally I'd look
23:23
at alternatives so we can develop
23:26
American suppliers to make them cheaper
23:28
again maybe renegotiate with the Union
23:30
because if they have if they have cost
23:37
our our parts to be too expensive to the
23:44
US it doesn't really matter that they
23:47
have higher sellers if through then they
23:48
get fired and yeah or make them cheaper
23:51
in other ways maybe integrate the supply
23:54
chain better teach them
23:55
how to be more efficient as well another
23:58
alternative is other countries their
24:00
Southeast Asia there's Mexico there's a
24:03
ton of other countries that could be
24:07
viable and perhaps even cheaper than
24:09
China or with less risks and then the
24:12
other one is are there certain parts
24:14
that we can internalize and manufacture
24:17
them within our company so this could
24:20
make them cheaper more predictable and
24:23
they try to evaluate these alternatives
24:26
just to see if there's any one of them
24:27
that's better than China okay all right
24:31
that's it that was pretty good okay I'm
24:34
not gonna asking for a recommendation
24:35
here because I didn't give you any any
24:37
datum of any kind yes so you can't
24:39
really say anything but they feel really
24:42
liked your analysis I guess that I think
24:45
you did too preservation he might come
24:46
back to with some to him with some data
24:48
in the future wait for it okay sounds
24:51
good do you think it did a good job in
24:52
this case yeah he did what do you think
24:55
it did best
24:55
what do you think I could have done
24:57
better okay so definitely the best point
25:02
in your analysis were that you in the
25:05
second question you raised some really
25:08
good points and what you would consider
25:10
the second question was why materials
25:13
increased yeah I'm gonna go the third
25:15
question then why what we should
25:18
consider when outsourcing your bike to
25:20
China when deciding whether we should or
25:22
not although some really good ideas here
25:24
were developing new suppliers would be
25:31
would have fixed costs in China and
25:33
that's something that very few people
25:34
would think of another month was
25:38
predictability of the supply chain
25:41
yeah and even so that was a good idea in
25:44
itself and having that impact
25:47
inventories was something that hardly
25:50
anyone would think of okay don't worry
25:51
those are real good points and one thing
25:54
that I wished you did and it helps that
25:56
I do the project out of manufacturing
25:58
probably yeah guys don't expect everyone
26:02
to think of all these issues yeah but at
26:05
the same time you can always learn from
26:07
this and it won't work all
26:09
for our Pro stability cases regarding
26:13
automobile companies Bennett you can
26:16
always know from now on that
26:18
predictability in the supply chain
26:20
allows you to have lower inventories and
26:22
unpredictable and unpredictable supplied
26:25
supply chain will not have you have
26:29
higher venturi yeah that's something you
26:31
can know for all cases and it works for
26:33
all other issues yeah any manufacturer
26:37
even McDonald's right yeah the App
26:39
Inventor ease of burgers and Brad's and
26:44
so on yeah and still like for all other
26:47
issues so we're talking let's see you
26:52
have financial costs because you're out
26:55
for a C to another country your problem
26:57
that probably means that you either have
27:01
risks that currency risk so your
27:04
currencies gotta go up or down and that
27:06
might change your costs or you're gonna
27:07
have hedging costs to prevent that right
27:09
anyway you're gonna have that in any
27:12
case where you're doing something in one
27:15
country and another yeah regardless of
27:17
whether you're outsourcing your
27:18
production or you're starting to arrange
27:21
my name when when its re-entry yeah
27:23
that's right
27:23
and one thing I wish to different was in
27:27
the beginning of the case I asked you to
27:30
help me solve the client's problem and
27:33
you went straight into and usually
27:36
what's happening yeah you know I wish to
27:38
unset oh so I messed up yeah yeah well
27:41
that's okay like that's what most people
27:42
do and it's not the end of the world but
27:44
I would have been much happier to have
27:47
you do it differently and say well so
27:49
the first thing I want to do is figure
27:50
out what their problem is but then
27:52
afterwards I want to come up with
27:53
options of course it depends on what the
27:57
problem is
27:57
but of course if I can't solve this
27:59
specific problem I'm going to come up
28:01
with solutions and all other ends of my
28:03
profitability tree yeah something like
28:04
that yeah so I'm gonna do it right now
28:06
so you're gonna help increasing
28:08
improving the profitability
28:10
step number one is to find the root
28:14
cause of what's causing this
28:17
profitability decrease so if it's a cost
28:21
problem which cost is right
28:23
probably it's a revenue problem is it
28:26
price or volume and in which product
28:28
line or rich region is causing the
28:30
problem yeah
28:31
step two is to find solutions to that
28:37
root cause and if we can't find any
28:40
solutions to that root cause what other
28:43
drivers can we work on to improve the
28:46
profitability problem and then in step
28:48
three would be to try to quantify each
28:57
solution and see how much it will help
29:01
solve the profit problem and also think
29:04
from a more qualitative strategic level
29:07
if the solution makes sense around
29:08
because maybe it has a really high
29:11
profit potential but it's not gonna work
29:13
in real life well that's that's how I
29:16
should have done the first question of
29:18
this case and then we went on to the
29:20
issue in our channel there is a video
29:22
we're gonna talk specifically about this
29:24
issue he'll talk about what should have
29:27
been done how to do it differently and
29:28
why it's better it's called the five
29:30
tactics to stand out in profitability
29:32
case interviews and it should be right
29:35
here on the right hand top corner of
29:37
your video if you're like most
29:39
candidates out there
29:40
you found the Diagnostics part of this
29:42
case not so hard but the last question
29:45
the hardest one we know that and we
29:47
found that way too and we were preparing
29:48
that's why we built a free course on the
29:51
case interview fundamentals where we
29:53
teach you how to answer any type of
29:54
question an interviewer can ask you
29:56
regardless of case type of Industry
29:58
anything and we want you to do that
30:00
without memorizing frameworks we want
30:03
you to learn to think like a consultant
30:05
because that's what really impresses
30:06
interviewers and brings home offers
30:08
chasing different fundamentals has been
30:10
helping hundreds of candidates get there
30:12
and VB offers so I don't want you to be
30:14
the one to miss out on that if you're
30:16
interested just go to Crafton KSS comm
30:18
slash free course and sign up right now

30:35
like this video you're
30:37
they also gonna like the other one
30:38
that's on your screen where I interview
30:40
Bruno with a McKinsey style case a
30:44
tougher one harder than this one that
30:47
you could probably find in a first or
30:49
final round in McKinsey Boehner BCG okay
30:53
I hope you liked this one and I'll see
30:55
